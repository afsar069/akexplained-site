# AK Explained — working rules

## 1. Site text is in simple English. Always.
Anything a visitor can read — headings, labels, buttons, form hints, error
messages, empty states, alt text — is written in **simple, plain English**.
**No Hinglish on the site.** This holds even when the conversation is in Hinglish.

Code comments may stay in Hinglish; they are for the maintainers, not visitors.

## 2. Nothing is invented
Dates, authorship, syllabus details, subscriber counts, student reviews, video
titles — none of it is made up. If a fact is not supplied or verifiable, leave a
placeholder and ask. The site's own About page states this rule to readers, so
breaking it breaks a promise already made.

## 3. Structure
- `index.html` — landing page (plain HTML + `assets/home.css` + `assets/home.js`)
- `_includes/base.njk` — layout for markdown article pages (Pages CMS publishes these)
- Other `*/index.html` — hub and utility pages, standalone HTML
- `quizzes/mcq/<age>/…` (hub, `build/`, `custom/`, `set-<n>/`) is **generated**, not hand-written:
  templates in `quizzes/mcq/_templates/` and `_includes/mcq-page.njk`, data in `_data/mcqSpec.json`
  (see rule 7). Change the template or the registry, never a generated page.
  `quizzes/mcq/index.html` (all ages) is still hand-written.
- `assets/site.css` — everything shared; `eleventy.config.js` syncs the header,
  footer, page-head motif and `nav.js` into every built page

The menu lives in two places and must stay in step: `_includes/base.njk` and the
sidebar markup copied into `index.html`.

## 4. Before pushing
`npx eleventy` must build clean, and no internal link may 404.

## 5. Deploys
Work goes on the feature branch. Merging to `main` publishes to akexplained.com,
so do that only when asked.

## 6. Off for now
- `write-a-review/` — built form, excluded from the build in `eleventy.config.js`.
  Turns on with student accounts; remove the one ignore line.
- Reviews on the home page show "Coming soon" until then. Published reviews live
  in `assets/reviews.json` (Pages CMS → Student Reviews).

## 7. MCQ question sets
Question files are made with `tools/mcq-skill/SKILL.md` (by Claude Work or another AI) and
arrive in the final format: `<age>-set-<n>-easy.json`, `-medium.json` and a `-report.md`.
Every question carries `src` (the page that proves it); the site does not show it yet.
To publish a set:
1. `python3 tools/mcq-skill/validate_mcq.py <easy> <medium> --notes notes/<article>/index.md --others <other sets' files of the age>` — no errors.
2. Spot-check about ten questions against their `src`, and every one a warning or the report flags.
   Fix or replace a wrong one; never keep a guess.
3. Files go to `assets/questions/`.
4. `_data/mcqSpec.json` is the registry. An age with no `sets` gets a "questions coming soon" hub
   (noindex, not linked from `/quizzes/mcq/`). To plan an age, add its `sets` (number, title, one-line
   meta, topics, levels) and the hub `topics` list; the owner supplies these, never invent them.
   To open a set, set `"live": true` and give it `lede`, `titleCase` (and `focus` if it has one).
   `rev` is read from the files. The hub row, build page, custom test and the set and review pages
   are then generated; the build stops with a message if a live set's file is missing.
5. First live set of an age: add the age slug to `LIVE_AGES` in `assets/mcq.js` so its card on
   `/quizzes/mcq/` links to the hub.
6. `npx eleventy`, link check, browser test, push the branch. `main` only when asked (rule 5).
`tools/` is ignored by the build and is not published.
